## Re name it!

Rename music files exported from iTunes.

iTunes exports music files (.wav or .mp3 etc.) typically to a path as in

`iTunes/Music/artistName/recordName/trackNumber trackName.wav`

which this tool converts for example to

`targetDirectory/artistName - trackName.wav`

so that the filename becomes more meaningful yet crisp.

This can for example be useful when transferring your iTunes collection to an SD card in .wav format for playback in your car.
